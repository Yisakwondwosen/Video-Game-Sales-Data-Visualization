# Video Game Sales Data Visualization Project

## Project Description
In this project, we analyze the sales data of video games to gather insights on factors that influence sales. We use the 'vgsales.csv' dataset, which contains a list of video games along with sales revenue, sales rank, platform, year of sale, genre, and more.

Our primary objectives are to:

1. Identify the most popular video games across different platforms and years.
2. Analyze the sales trends over the years and identify potential temporal patterns.
3. Discover the most successful genres and regions.
4. Identify what factors contribute most to game sales.

## Project Steps

### Data Preprocessing
The first step in our analysis is to preprocess the data. This includes handling missing data, correcting data types, standardizing column names, etc. Using Python libraries such as pandas and numpy will be beneficial for this step.

### Data Visualization
Once the data is cleaned and preprocessed, we will then use data visualization techniques to create plots such as bar charts, scatter plots, heat maps, etc. These plots will be used to illustrate the findings from our analysis, making it easier to understand patterns and trends in the data. Libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly can be used for this step.

### Statistical Analysis
To gain further insights, we will apply statistical methods to our data. These methods can help us identify patterns and trends and understand what factors have the most impact on game sales.

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of this project, we hope to gain insights into the factors affecting video game sales and demonstrate the power of data visualization techniques in extracting meaningful information. This could be valuable for game developers, publishers, and sales representatives to make strategic decisions to increase sales.

## Usage
The code for this project is written in Python and can be run on a local machine. The required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file.
